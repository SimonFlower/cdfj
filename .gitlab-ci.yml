# GitLab CI to build cdfj and install it in Geomag Artifactory
#
# Most of the configuration is in pom.xml
# The authentication is in .m2/settings.xml
# To work, you need to set MVN_REPO_USER and MVN_REPO_PASS variables to
#   the login credentials to the Artifactory repository where the code
#   will be deployed
# A keystore and trust store that are setup with the certificates to access
# the maven repositories in pom.xml are included in this project
# If additional maven repositories are added in pom.xml the truststore will have 
# to be updated. 
# Instructions on how to use SSL keys with maven repositories can be found in
# http://geomag_websites.glpages.ad.nerc.ac.uk/handover_documentation/SimonFlower/
# in the section Web Servers->Use of http and https here
